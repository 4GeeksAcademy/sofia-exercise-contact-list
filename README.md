Technologies: HTML, CSS, JS, React, React Router, and Context.

Hello! It is time to start doing professional front-end applications. This time
we will be creating a small contact management application that allows users to:
Read, Create, Update and Delete contacts. 

You may use this gif: [Check it out here!](https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-contact-list/blob/master/preview.gif?raw=true)

## ðŸŒ±  How to start this project

Do not clone this repository because we are going to be using a different template.

We recommend opening the `react boilerplate` using a provisioning tool like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod). Alternatively, you can clone it on your local computer using the `git clone` command.

This is the repository you need to open or clone:

```
https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/react-hello
```

**ðŸ‘‰ Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-start-a-project).

ðŸ’¡ Important: Remember to save and upload your code to GitHub by creating a new repository, updating the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and uploading the code to your new repository using the `add`, `commit` and `push` commands from the git terminal.

2. Install the /node_modules
```
$ npm install
```
3. Run the webpack development server
```
$ npm run start
```

This boilerplate contains no real functionalities but it has 99.99% of the HTML/CSS that you'll need for the project, allowing you to focus on the functionality.

**Please use the Context for this project:** The boilerplate comes with the Context configured. Check the ```/store``` folder.

**Note: You'll need to code all functionalities.**

### :memo: This project is divided in: 

#### :two: different views: 

1. Contact: Contains the list of contacts.
2. AddContact: It's just a form used to create or update contacts.

#### One component:
ContactCard: displays just one contact.

## TO-DO functionalities

- You have to add the code needed to make your application handle contacts, specifically: 
    - create, 
    - update, 
    - and delete.
- (Optional) Ask the user for confirmation before deleting, use the Modal component for that.

All the functionalities must be implemented in the ```actions``` object (store.js).

Hint: start with some dummy content in the store (store.js).

```Fetch``` the data from the API: https://assets.breatheco.de/apis/fake/contact/

Hint: Use Postman to try the API endpoints before coding.  

That is it! Start coding your React Application :)
